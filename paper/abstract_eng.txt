We consider the problem of numerical solution to the initial boundary value problem for a fractional generalization of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with the Riemann-Liouville time-fractional derivative.

The presence of a fractional derivative leads to a linear increasing computational cost as the number of time step increases.

As a result, solving even a relatively simple one-dimensional problem requires very considerable computational resources, which leads to the necessity for developing parallel algorithms for its solving.

We present a numerical scheme for solving the problem and an algorithm for its parallelization, as well as an estimation of its efficiency.

The proposed approach is justified by the results of computational experiments performed on computing systems with shared memory.
