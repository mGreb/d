\section{Introduction}
This document contains guidelines for \LaTeX users 
(you can also use guidelines for MS~Word users) and can be considered as a template. 

\section{Paper preparation}
Pages of the presented paper should have size
$297 \times 210$~mm (A4 format). All margins should have the same size of 25~mm.

Numbering, forced page breaks and footers are not allowed.

Times New Roman (or equivalent) is used as a font of the paper. 
Paragraphs are typed by 11~pt font size with width alignment, 
single line spacing, and automatic hyphenation. Using bold style in the text is 
undesirable. Paragraphs are not separated by intervals and begin with a 7~mm indented line.

\subsection{Headings}
For the title of the paper bold Times New Roman font with 16~pt size and center alignment should be used. 
Title is separated by one blank line from all the text above.

List of authors appears in 12~pt Times New Roman with center alignment and is 
separated from the title by a single blank line with 16~pt size. Authors are listed 
through commas, initials are written before the last name. 

Organization has 12~pt Times New Roman font with center alignment and is separated 
from the list of authors by one blank line of 6~pt size. Please, specify the official names (not abbreviations) of organizations. 
If authors work in different organizations, two or more organizations can be listed through commas. 
In this case author's affiliation is identified by the footnote.

Header of a section is made without a break from the first paragraph with left-alignment. 
Above and below the header there is a single blank line separation. 
Examples of titles and styles are shown in table ~\ref{table1}.

\subsection{Figures and tables}
All figures and tables should have a caption, typed by 10~pt font with top and bottom 6~pt 
separation and central alignment. Caption to a table is placed above the table, 
caption to a figure~--- under the figure. 

\textbf{Assertions}, \textbf{lemmas} and \textbf{theorems} should be formatted as separate paragraphs and 
should be numbered in order of appearance starting from number one, for example, \textbf{Theorem~1}.

\begin{table}[!ht]
	\caption{Heading examples}
	\label{table1}
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\bf Type of the header} &
		\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\bf Font size and style} \\
		\hline
		\LARGE\bf A title of the paper & 16~pt, bold \\
		\hline
		\Large\bf First-level header & 14~pt, bold \\
		\hline
		\large\bf Second-level header& 12~pt, bold \\
		\hline
		\large\it Third-level header & 12~pt, italic \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Formulae and source code}
Formulae are typed with standard \LaTeX features.

Source code should be formatted with Courier New font(or equivalent), 
of 10~pt size (see an example on Fig.~\ref{listing-sort}). 
Bold and italic font is allowed in the source code.

    int i;
    int j;
    int k;
    double m;
    for(i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        m = arr(i-1);
        k = i;
        for(j = i; j <= n; j++) {
            if( m>arr(j-1) ) {
                m = arr(j-1);
                k = j;
            }
        }
        arr(k-1) = arr(i-1);
        arr(i-1) = m;
    }
}
